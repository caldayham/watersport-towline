## Introduction  

There is no doubt that whipping accross lake lagunita on a wakeboard using a car powered tow rope that stretches over half a kilometer would be an amazing solution to the problem of filling time on a saturday morning, at least 
in my mind.  

That is all this is, a hopefully simple solution that also needs to be low cost as I'm not sure how much of the materials will be recoverable and/or reusable, plus I'm not rolling in money just yet.
